# Learning log: shipping weekly

I set a small rule for 2025: ship one thing every week. It could be a UI refactor, a new API integration, or a short MDX post like this one.

## Guardrails

- A scoped checklist before the week starts
- A visible demo link on Friday
- A tiny retro in public, even when it flops

## Wins so far

The cadence keeps momentum high and makes context switching painless. My React muscle memory is sharper, and design decisions are easier because I have a backlog of patterns that already shipped.
